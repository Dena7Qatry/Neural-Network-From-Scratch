# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

## Overview
This project implements a **fully-connected neural network from scratch** (no deep learning libraries for the core algorithm) and tests it on two datasets:
- **IRIS dataset**
- **MNIST dataset**

The aim is to build a fundamental understanding of how neural networks work internally, covering forward propagation, backpropagation, and weight updates.

## Features
- Implementation of feed-forward neural networks from scratch
- Training on both **classification (IRIS)** and **image recognition (MNIST)**
- Adjustable network architecture (layers, neurons, activation functions)
- Comparison of accuracy across datasets

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalize features
   - Train-test split
2. **Network Implementation**
   - Forward pass
   - Backpropagation
   - Gradient descent
3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy and loss curves

---

## Results
- Achieved reasonable accuracy on **IRIS classification**
- Achieved reasonable accuracy on **MNIST digits**, demonstrating scalability
